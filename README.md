# Example scripts
This repository contains a collection of example scripts for the usage of ```pyVPRM``` which can be installed from here 
https://github.com/tglauch/pyVPRM/. To download the repository run
```
git clone https://github.com/tglauch/pyVPRM_examples.git
```

Currently only the scripts in ```./wrf_preprocessor``` and ```./vprm_predictions``` can be directly executed. Example files for running the VPRM fit will be included soon. The files in ```./sat_data_download``` provide examples of how ```pyVPRM``` can be used to download VIIRS and MODIS data. More information can be found in the README files in the respective folders and the comments in the scripts. 

Note: The example scripts come with a set of example data files. Hence the download of the repository requires around 100 MB disk space. The data have only been marginally pre-processed to limit the amount of memory required.
